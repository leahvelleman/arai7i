## Consonants
Here are the consonant sounds of Arai’i, and the way they're written in the roman alphabet.

|                    | Bilabial   | Alveolar  | Postalveolar | Retroflex | Velar     | Glottal   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Voiceless stop** | **p** /p/  | **t** /t/ | **ch** /tʃ/  |           | **k** /k/ | **’** /ʔ/ |
| **Voiced stop**    | **b** /b/  | **d** /d/ | **j** /dʒ/   |           | **g** /g/ |           |
| **Fricative**      | **wh** /ɸ/ | **s** /s/ | **sh** /ʃ/   | **r** /ȥ/ |           | **h** /h/ |
| **Nasal**          | **m** /m/  | **n** /n/ |              |           |           |           |

Most are pronounced like English speakers would expect, but there are a few unusual sounds:
- The **wh** sound is like the *f* in Japanese or the *wh* in te reo Māori. It sounds a bit like a cross between English *f* and *wh*.
- The **r** is like the *r* in Mandarin, or a little like the *s* in English *measure*.
- The **’** is a glottal stop, like in a stereotypical Cockney pronunciation of *bottle*. 


> [!NOTE]
> The postalveolar sounds **ch j sh** are *just barely* phonemic. Historically, they come from the sequences /\*tj \*dj \*sj/, or from /\*t \*d \*s/ before /\*i/. But [[vowel fusion]] can produce examples of /ti di si/ that didn't change, so there are a few minimal pairs, like **chi’o** *fish* (from \***tiʔo**) and **ti’o** *words, message* (from **\*toiʔo**).

Consonants can be single or double. Double consonants are pronounced longer than single ones, and  written double in romanization: **pp**, **tt**, and so on. The two-letter consonants **wh sh ch** are written **wwh ssh tch** when they're double.

## Vowels
Tequi has four vowel qualities: /a e i o/, romanized **a e i o**, and three diphthongs, /ia ie io/, romanized **ya ye yo**. 

Vowels can be pronounced with different lengths — and, rarely, with tone. Vowels before a glottal stop or a double consonant are pronounced extra-short.

| Tone                       | Pronunciation | Spelling |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Short                      | \[a\]         | **a**    |
| Long                       | \[aː\]        | **ā**    |
| Long and with falling tone | \[aː˥˩\]      | **â**    |
| Extra-short                | \[ă]          | **a’**   |

Because tone is so rare, Tequi sounds, not like a tonal language, but like one with a varied rhythm. 

## Syllables
A syllable contains a single vowel or diphthong. It can start with that vowel, or with a consonant.

A syllable can end with a glottal stop or with **h**. 

If the glottal stop comes before a consonant, it assimilates to become a copy of that consonant — this is where double consonants come from. Whether or not a glottal stop assimilates, it also shortens the vowel that comes before it.

In some situations, when two vowels come in a row, they undergo [[vowel fusion]]. In other cases, they don't. This can lead to situations with two vowels in a row — or even two of the same vowel in a row. When this happens, they form two separate syllables.
