## Consonants
Here are the consonant sounds of Arai’i, and the way they're written in the roman alphabet.

|                    | Bilabial   | Alveolar  | Postalveolar | Retroflex | Velar     | Glottal   |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Voiceless stop** | **p** /p/  | **t** /t/ | **ch** /tʃ/  |           | **k** /k/ | **’** /ʔ/ |
| **Voiced stop**    | **b** /b/  | **d** /d/ | **j** /dʒ/   |           | **g** /g/ |           |
| **Fricative**      | **wh** /ɸ/ | **s** /s/ | **sh** /ʃ/   | **r** /ȥ/ |           | **h** /h/ |
| **Nasal**          | **m** /m/  | **n** /n/ |              |           |           |           |

Most are pronounced like English speakers would expect, but there are a few unusual sounds:
- The **wh** sound is like the *f* in Japanese or the *wh* in te reo Māori. It sounds a bit like a cross between English *f* and *wh*.
- The **r** is like the *r* in Mandarin, or a little like the *s* in English *measure*.
- The **’** is a glottal stop, like in a stereotypical Cockney pronunciation of *bottle*. 


> [!NOTE]
> The postalveolar sounds **ch j sh** are *just barely* phonemic. Historically, they come from the sequences /\*tj \*dj \*sj/, or from /\*t \*d \*s/ before /\*i/. But [[vowel fusion]] can produce examples of /ti di si/ that didn't change, so there are a few minimal pairs, like **chi’o** *fish* (from \***tiʔo**) and **ti’o** *words, message* (from **\*toiʔo**).

Consonants can be single or double. Double consonants are pronounced longer than single ones, and  written double in romanization: **pp**, **tt**, and so on. The two-letter consonants **wh sh ch** are written **wwh ssh tch** when they're double.

## Vowels
Tequi has four vowel qualities: /a e i o/, romanized **a e i o**, and three diphthongs, /ia ie io/, romanized **ya ye yo**. 

Vowels can be pronounced with different lengths — and, rarely, with tone. Vowels before a glottal stop or a double consonant are pronounced extra-short.

| Tone                       | Pronunciation | Spelling |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Short                      | \[a\]         | **a**    |
| Long                       | \[aː\]        | **ā**    |
| Long and with falling tone | \[aː˥˩\]      | **â**    |
| Extra-short                | \[ă]          | **a’**   |

Because tone is so rare, Tequi sounds, not like a tonal language, but like one with a varied rhythm. 

## Syllables
A syllable contains a single vowel or diphthong. It can start with that vowel, or with a consonant.

A syllable can end with a glottal stop or with **h**. 

If the glottal stop comes before a consonant, it assimilates to become a copy of that consonant — this is where double consonants come from. Whether or not a glottal stop assimilates, it also shortens the vowel that comes before it.

In some situations, when two vowels come in a row, they undergo [[vowel fusion]]. In other cases, they don't. This can lead to situations with two vowels in a row — or even two of the same vowel in a row. When this happens, they form two separate syllables. 

## Sound changes
### Consonant changes

Words could, historically, end in consonants. But these consonants only survive before a vowel: that is, either
* Before a vowel-initial suffix
* Before a word that starts with a vowel

|               |                |                |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **mani’**     | \[ma.nĭʔ\]     | *going*        |
| **man apara** | \[ma.na.pa.ȥa] | *go to school* |

Elsewhere, the consonant disappears. This happens
* At the end of a phrase
* Before a consonant-initial suffix
* Before a word that starts with a consonant

|             |               |                    |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| **mā!**     | \[maː\]       | *go!*              |
| **māki**    | \[maː.ki\]    | *route; way to go* |
| **mā de’o** | \[maː.de.ʔo\] | *go home*          |

The disappearing consonant also leaves a trace behind:
* A disappearing fricative becomes an **h**
* A disappearing voiceless stop becomes a glottal stop
* A disappearing voiced consonant lengthens the previous vowel, as in the example above

|                 |                  |                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **chapi’**      | \[tʃa.piʔ\]      | *grabbing*                        |
| **chap oki ni** | \[tʃa.po.ki.ni\] | *grab my hand*                    |
| **cha’!**       | \[tʃaʔ\]         | *speak!*                          |
| **chakki**      | \[tʃak.ki\]      | *handle; thing to grab*           |
| **chad de’o**   | \[tʃad.de.ʔo\]   | *make it home* (lit. *grab home*) |

### Vowel fusion
Some suffixes that start with a vowel can *fuse* with a stem that ends in a vowel. 
* **i+a**, **i+e**, and **i+o** become **ya**, **ye**, and **yo**
* **a+e**, **o+e**, and **a+i** become **e**
* **a+o**, and **o+a** become **o
* **o+i** becomes **i**
Suffixes that can fuse are written starting with a plus sign. Ones that can't are written starting with a hyphen.

# The Tequi alphabet
## Etymological spelling
The spelling of a word in Tequi reflects its etymology, not just its pronunciation. In this way, it is like English. Unlike English, though, Tequi spelling is very regular. You need to learn a lot of rules, but once you learn those rules, you can sound out any word.

Etymological spelling has some convenient results. If two words sound the same, but are made up of different parts, they are usually spelled differently. This means when you're reading you can tell which word of the two is intended. 

| Word      | Meaning                   | Tequi spelling | Component parts                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **soni’** | *giving*                  | `SO+ON+IK`     | `SO+ON` *give* <br>`+IK` infinitive suffix                           |
| **soni’** | *praying*                 | `SA-O-NO+IK`   | `SA` *say* <br>`O-NO` *prayer* <br>`+IK` infinitive suffix           |
| **toko**  | *squid*                   | `TO-KO`        | `TO-KO` *squid*                                                      |
| **toko**  | *\[tall thing\] standing* | `TO+OK-V`      | `TO` *tall shape* <br>`+OK` *standing*<br>`–V` adverb forming suffix |

Another convenient thing is that you can always recognize the root of a word, even if its sounds have changed. `SO+ON` *give* is spelled the same whether it's pronounced **son–** or **sō–**. `SO+ON-TI-MA` *give food* is spelled the same whether it's pronounced **sōchima** or **sōchime**. 

| Word         | Meaning       | Tequi spelling   |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **sono**     | *give*        | `SO+ON-V`        |
| **soni’**    | *giving*      | `SO+ON+IK`       |
| **soniki**   | *giving to…*  | `SO+ON+IK-I`     |
| **sōchima**  | *give food*   | `SO+ON-TI-MA`    |
| **sōchime’** | *giving food* | `SO+ON-TI-MA-IK` |

## The letters
The Tequi alphabet has 70 letters.  
- 33 *opening* letters represent a single vowel, or a consonant and then a vowel.
- 33 *closing* letters represent a single vowel, or a vowel and then a consonant.
- 4 *special* letters repeat a previous sound. They're used to represent [[reduplication]].

|       |       |       |        |        |        |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `PA`  | `PI`  | `PO`  | `+AP`  | `+IP`  | `+OP`  |
| `TA`  | `TI`  | `TO`  | `+AT`  | `+IT`  | `+OT`  |
| `KA`  | `KI`  | `KO`  | `+AK`  | `+IK`  | `+OK`  |
| `ʔA`  | `ʔI`  | `ʔO`  | `+Aʔ`  | `+Iʔ`  | `+Oʔ`  |
| `SA`  | `SI`  | `SO`  | `+AS`  | `+IS`  | `+OS`  |
| `WHA` | `WHI` | `WHO` | `+AWH` | `+IWH` | `+OWH` |
| `HA`  | `HI`  | `HO`  | `+AH`  | `+IH`  | `+OH`  |
| `MA`  | `MI`  | `MO`  | `+AM`  | `+IM`  | `+OM`  |
| `NA`  | `NI`  | `NO`  | `+AN`  | `+IN`  | `+ON`  |
| `RA`  | `RI`  | `RO`  | `+AR`  | `+IR`  | `+OR`  |
| `A`   | `I`   | `O`   | `+A`   | `+I`   | `+O`   |
| `V`   | `L`   | `LL`  | `W`    |        |        |

The four special letters are used to write reduplication:
- The letter transcribed `V` repeats the most recent vowel sound.
- The letter transcribed `L` repeats the most recent letter.
- The letter transcribed `LL` repeats the most recent two letters.
- The letter transcribed `W` repeats the most recent word.

The voiced sounds **b**, **d**, and **g** are written with letters from the `P`, `T`, and `K` rows followed by a single slash. 

"Odd" sounds are written by following any letter with a double slash. This is used to spell foreign words, to spell onomatopoeia, to represent falling [[tone]], and to [[flip]] the vowel in a reduplicated word.

|               |                                        |                |                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **küra**      | \[kyȥa]<br>(\[kiȥa\] for monolinguals) | `KO//-RA`      | *beer*                        |
| **shhh**      | \[ʃʃʃ\]                                | `SI//`         | *(sound for shooing animals)* |
| **matâ**      | \[matâ\]                               | `MA-TA//`      | *that over there*             |
| **migi mogi** | \[migi mogi\]                          | `MI+IK/-I W//` | *pieces all over*             |

## Sound changes in spelling

The closing letters all can go through [[vowel fusion]] with the previous letter. 

|            |           |             |     |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | --- |
| **deke**   | \[deke\]  | `DA+IK-V`   |     |
| **ogyori** | \[ogjoȥi] | `O-GI+O-RI` |     |
| **sah**    | \[sa̤:\]  | `SA+AH`     |     |
| **‘ati**   | \[ʔati\]  | `ʔA-TO+I`   |     |

In particular, this means that you can use a closing letter after an opening letter with the same vowel, and the two vowels combine into one, as in **sah** `SA+AH`. 

The opening letters don't go through fusion.

|           |           |           |     |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --- |
| **maiki** | \[maiki\] | `MA-I-KI` |     |
| **okio**  | \[okio]   | `O-KI-O`  |     |
| **saah**  | \[saa̤:\] | `SA-AH`   |     |
| **atoi**  | \[atoi\]  | `A-TO-I`  |     |

Closing letters can also go through [[consonant changes]]. 

|           |            |            |     |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --- |
| **mō**    | \[mo:\]    | `MO+ON`    |     |
| **pyah**  | \[pja̤:]   | `PI+AS`    |     |
| **tekki** | \[tek:i\]  | `TA+IP-KI` |     |
| **sah‘i** | \[sa̤:ʔi\] | `SA-AS-ʔI` |     |
| **pōko**  | \[po:ko\]  | `PO+AR-KO` |     |

`T`, `D`, and `S` palatalize before `I`, whether it comes from the same letter or a different one. So `A-TI` and `AT-I` both spell **achi**. To spell **t**, **d**, or **s** before an **i** or **y** sound, take advantage of vowel contraction: `TO+I` spells **ti** and `TO+I+A` spells **tya**.
