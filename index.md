Most are pronounced like English speakers would expect, but there are a few unusual sounds:
- The **wh** sound is like the *f* in Japanese or the *wh* in te reo Māori. It sounds a bit like a cross between English *f* and *wh*.
- The **r** is like the *r* in Mandarin, or a little like the *s* in English *measure*.
- The **’** is a glottal stop, like in a stereotypical Cockney pronunciation of *bottle*.
